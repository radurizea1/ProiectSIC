This project was created to control the temperature of a room in case someone is in it.
The sensors that will be used for the application are: 
  Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) 
  Temperature sensors (DHT11) 
The operation of my project is: a reference will be set at which the temperature in the room will be maintained / the execution element will work constantly until it reaches the protection limit.
